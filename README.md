# Note: Still a WIP

Parses an Yu-Gi-Oh! card description into an AST, which can then be used to do stuff! (10/10 description)

# Reasoning
After looking at old Yu-Gi-Oh! cards I had lying around, I realized that the descriptions act much like a programming language (I guess it is pretty obvious, but never really put much thought into). I began to think about how it would be possible to parse the description into an AST (Abstract syntax tree), and be able to do whatever you would do with said AST (i.e compiling down to a Lua script that can be used in YGOPro)
